A Clojure library for the calculation of improper integrals.
The implementation is based on the Fortran library [quadpack](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/quadpack_double/quadpack_double.html) ([Source](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/quadpack_double/quadpack_double.f90)).

**Currently, only Linux 64 bit and Windows 64 bit are supported.**
More target platforms can be supported by compiling the native library for these.

## Usage

Minimal example:

```clojure
(require '[cquad.core :as cquad])

(cquad/improper-integral
  (fn ^double [^double x] (/ 1.0 (inc (* x x))))
  :negative-infinity,
  :positive-infinity)
;=> 3.141592653589793
```
